# Personal Golf Strokes Gained
I've analyzed data from manually tracking personal golf stats:
- 168 holes tracking strokes gained from Mark Broadie's "Every Shot Counts" [book](https://www.amazon.com/Every-Shot-Counts-Revolutionary-Performance/dp/1592407501)
- ~25% include distance and direction result based on intended shot (ex: long and left)
